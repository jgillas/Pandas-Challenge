Summary: 

To start with while looking at this data we were dealing with 15 different schools looking at their math and english scores. We were also looking at their math and reading average scores and then their overall passing scores. The data consists of 8 Charter schools and 7 District schools. We broke the data down by individual school so that we could see what each school was working with. Then we broke it down so we could see the top 5 schools and the bottom 5 schools. When we did this we saw that all the top 5 schools were Charter schools while all the bottom 5 schools were district schools. We then broke down each school by grade (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th) and looked at their math and reading scores by grade. We then looked at scores by school spening and broke it down by <585, 585-630, 630-645, 645-680. Then we looked it scores by school size and broke it down by small (<1000, Medium (1000-2000), and Large (2000-5000). Lastly we looked at the score by school type (Charter and District)

Conclusions: 

One conclusion that can be drawn from these calcuations and from the data is that Chater schools have a much higher overall passing percentage than District schools have. Chater schools have an overall passing of 90.43% while District shcools have an overall passing percentage of 53.67%. The main area where District schools struggle is the percent passing math category. This means that kids that go to the District schools are struggling passing math while they are at school. This would be an area where District schools will want to focus on and try to raise that percentage becasue if they can raise their percent passing math it will help to raise their overall passing percentage. 

Another conclusion that can be drawn from these calcuations is that schools that spend the least amount of money have the highest overall passing percentage. Schools that spend <$585 have an overall passing percentage of 90.37. The data shows that the more money a school spends the lower their overall passing percentage is. This is interesting becuase I bet people always think the more money a school has the better off it is and the better off the students are. However, that is not what this data is showing us. This data tells us that schools that spend the least amount of money have the highest overall passing percentage. This might be that schools that have less money to spend, spend it on the more important aspects of school like academics which would increase their overall percentage. Not only do schools who spend the least amount of money have the highest overall passing percentage but they also have the highest percent passing both math and reading. This shows that schools who have the least amount of money to spend, know where to spend the money they do have inorder to help their students succeed.
